<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
<p>
	For sprint 1, I wanted to create a basic pizza menu which had two options available on it. I also wanted the program
	to ask the user if they wanted delivery or pick up and made the program ask for the  user's name. As well as this, I
	also got the program to print out the list of pizza options available, ask the user what they wanted and repeated what
	they chose.
	</p>
<p>
	This will be the basic structure for my program, though for my next sprint, I need to work out how I should
	create the ordering part of the program. For my ordering program, it needs to be able to connect to both the pizza menu list
	and the options list for what the user wants to do. For this, I will do some testing to see if the ordering part would work
	better as a part of the main function or as it's own separate function. After I figure out how I want to design the order
	system, I want to add functions that allow the user to add the number of pizzas the customer ordered/add more than 1 pizza
	and also take away amounts. I also want to have the cost of the order update depending on how many pizzas are ordered.
</p>
				<p>
	I also want to change the design of the delivery and pick up system, so that the code isn't as repetitive as it is currently
	the same code in both functions except one is for delivery and one is for pick up and it seems unconventional.
</p>
				<p>
	I am happy with how my first sprint has ran and I think it suits the basic purpose fine, though there are definitely a lot
	of things I still need to fix.

<p>This was my first design of the program with the add and remove pizza functions. I had an
order function which just had the user select a pizza type and then had a message saying
they had selected it. There was  not much of a purpose and it was not a suitable design for
this sprint. I had made it with the intention of the user being able to "review" their order
and then make changes, but with this sprint's design of the adding and removing pizza functions
it did not work.</p>
<h3>Removing more pizzas than available</h3>

</div>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>On this test, I tried removing more pizzas than what was available, and the amount of pizzas went into the negatives.
For a future sprint, I am going to make it so that the program only allows the user to delete what is already present.</p>


						<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>
	In this sprint I added three new functions. I separated my main function into the main function and the order function,
	I also added an adding to the pizza quantity function and I added a remove pizza quantity function. The main function now just has
	a basic menu which asks the user if they want delivery or pick up and redirects the user's choice to the function that they selected.
	From there, the delivery or pick up function then redirects to the order function.
				</p>
	<p>
	I will add more to the delivery and pick up
	functions in my next sprint, so that the program asks for the address for and phone number for the delivery option
		and asks for the phone number in the pick up option.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the order function, it has a menu which asks the user if they want to add pizza quantity to the order, remove from the pizza quantity
	or quit. If the user chooses to add to the pizza quantity, it redirects them to the add_pizza function.
	</p>
	<p>
		The add_pizza function prints
	out the menu and then asks the user what pizza they want to add. The function then adds to the pizza quantity depending on the amount
	the user selects and updates the cost. If then asks the user if they want to add another pizza and if they do, the add_pizza function runs again, if they don't the program returns to the order menu, where the user
	can then choose to add another pizza again, remove pizzas or quit. In a later version, I will set restrictions on how many pizzas
		the user can order.
	</p>
	<p>
		The remove pizza function allows user to select a pizza type from the
	list and choose the quantity of pizza that they want to remove. However, an issue I have with this is that the user is able to go into
	negative quantities. I want to make the program to only allow the user to reduce the amount that is present and I will likely fix this in my
	next sprint or when I do validation.
	</p>

<br>
<p>
	While I was creating sprint 2 of the program I had to run quite a few tests as I had issues when I was designing the order function.
	As I said before, I split the main function into the main function and an order function. One of the reasons I did this was because
	I had a lot of repetition in my delivery and pick up functions. As they both do the same thing for the main part of the pizza
	program (which was what I was designing in sprint 2), it made sense to make an order function and then redirect the delivery and pick up
	function to it. I also decided to do this for my quit option in the add and remove functions, it needed somewhere to redirect to
	after the user was done and I didn't want it repeating the delivery or pick up messages and I also didn't want it to redirect to the main menu.
</p>
	<p>
	Then, I had an issue with the quitting option in the order function. First, instead of stopping the program, it would redirect to the start
	of the order function. Then, I changed something and it would redirect to the main menu and the user would have to press quit again for the
	program to stop. This design was unconventional and I had to run some tests to figure out where to put/remove loops and I figured out how to
	allow the program to quit at the order function.

</p>
<p>
	For my next sprint, I want to add a function that allows the user to add new pizza types to the menu list. I also want to add a function
	that allows users to delete a pizza from the menu/order. As well as this, I plan on adding a review/confirm function where the user can
	see their order and confirm it. After they confirm their order a new order should start. I also want to add a function that just prints out
	the menu.

<h4>Delivery cost issue</h4>
<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/s_3d2_2.jpg">
<p>In my program, I calculate the total cost individually (so that there is
not a total cost that is constantly updated in the program). As a result of this,
I have to calculate the cost by multiplying the quantity by cost. So, for the delivery
cost I had to make it a list item. I put the delivery cost as "extras" and the quantity
is 1 when the user selects the delivery option. I originally had the extras list
add to the main order list. However, this design was not good because as you can see
from the image, it meant that the extras list could be added to or removed. I fixed
this issue by making a list just for storing "extras". This is a better design because
it is also more flexible. It means that it would be easy to add other "extras" type items
in the extras list in the future.</p>

	For my next sprint, I will need to address this issue and set

	logically feasible for a customer to be able to order 50 pizzas
	and the amount of pizzas/cost should also not be a negative number.

so that if the user enters a pizza that is already present in the
order list, it redirects them to a different function or doesn't let
them continue. This needs to be addressed because I also want
to set restrictions on how much pizzas someone can order per pizza type
and allowing the user to enter multiple of the same pizza type defeats
the purpose of restricting quantities.</p>

<h3>Sprint Review</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
	In my 3rd sprint, I decided to do change the base structure of my pizza program. In my previous version, I had the order details
	stored within a list called "pizza_list", where when a pizza is added to the order, the quantity would update within the pizza list
	and the cost would be set to $5 within the list. However, this design was not flexible and also caused some problems when I wanted
	to further extend my program, so I had to change it.

	<p>One of the problems it caused was that when I was creating my review function,
	I couldn't print out the customer's order without printing out all of the pizza list options (so it would print pizza options
	where the quantity was 0 as well as pizza options that had a quantity more than 0). Visually, this was not appealing and it didn't
	make sense as a program to print out what the user had not ordered. So, I decided to instead use a list to store the pizza menu
	options, an empty list to store customer order details.
	</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
	In the empty customer order list, it allowed me to add what the user ordered and the list kept updating as they ordered more or less.
	As the list only contained what the user ordered, it meant that I was able to only print what they ordered in the review function.
</p>
				<p>With the new program, the new pizza function is used to add pizzas to the order and then the add pizza
				function allows the user to add to the quantity of pizzas for pizza type that is already in the order list. For my
					next sprint, I want to combine the add, remove and delete pizza type functions in a menu option called "edit order".
					This would make the main menu less confusing and easier to read. In the "edit order" option I want to present the
					options of adding or removing to the user. Then, the user will be shown the order list and can add or remove pizza quantities.
				</p>
<p>
	I also removed the order function. The order function was excessive and unnecessary as I could include everything in the order function
	in the main function. It was also confusing to work with when I was creating exit options as it had to go through the main function to quit.
</p>
				<p>
	In version 3, as mentioned earlier, I added a review function. The review function allows users to see what the order consists of and
	review the customer details such as deliver address, name, etc. In the review function, it asks the user if they wish to confirm the order
	or if they want to continue adding more items to the order. It also prints out the customer details. I will update this in my next version
	to make the review function more thorough, however. I want to rearrange the format so that the information given is clearer.
</p>
				<p>
	I also changed the order of operations slightly so that the program runs more smoothly. I now have the delivery/pick up
	function as an option in the menu instead of starting the program with the deliver/pick up option. I am also going to have the program not start
	with adding a new pizza immediately and instead give the user a menu of options. To make sure the order only goes through if a pizza is added
	to the order, I am going to validate my program so that the review function cannot be called if nothing has been added to the order. I will
	also validate so that if the user enters a pizza that is already in their order, it redirects to the add pizza function instead of entering
	a value twice. I will also validate integer entries so that the program will not crash if a value that
					is not an integer is entered and I need to validate for string entries so that there is maximum and minimum
					lengths. I need to validate for string lengths to minimise the chances of invalid/fake names will be entered.
</p>
				<p>
	I am also going to have the delivery/pick up function repeat the details the user entered as a confirmation message to check that the details
	are correct and give the user the option to change the details if they are wrong. I also need to validate the phone number so that
					the program only accepts phone numbers with a certain length and prefix.
</p>

<h1 id="Sprint 4">Sprint 4</h1>
<p>Aim: My aim for this sprint is to validate all inputs so that the program does not crash, format the program so that
it is easier to read and to combine the add, remove and delete pizzas options.</p>

	In this test, I tried getting the user's input as an integer then

phone number entered matches the requirements and I also used the
	length of the string to determine if it was a valid phone number.
</p>

<h3>Test 2</h3>

	<br>
	<p>
		This is my phone number validation test table which I used to compare the functionality of the different methods
		of phone number validation.
	</p>
	<p>I found that only test 3 worked for a normal 02 and 04 number. 02 and 04 numbers are the main styles of phone numbers
	used in New Zealand so it was imperative that the method I chose was able to function with this properly. I found
	that as test 1 & 2 used integer inputs, the 0 disappeared, even when test 1 converted the integer to string.</p>
	<p>
		Test 1 also crashed when I entered a string value as I had not validated it to only accept integers.
	</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Test 2 accepted a non New Zealand phone prefix as it didn't validate for prefixes, only integer and length.
	The method I choose should really only accept New Zealand phone numbers as it doesn't make sense in terms
	of delivery and pick up for an overseas phone number to be able to order a pizza.</p>
	<p>Overall, as you can see, Test 3 was able to fill all the requirements for my validation testing, so it is the method
	I ended up choosing to use for my program. It was able to validate for length as well as prefixes and only accepted
	integer values.</p>

<h3>Sprint Review</h3>
<p>
Sprint 4 was my final sprint and overall I am satisfied with how it turned out. I had a bit of trouble with the validation
	functions as there was a lot of content that I was not familiar with and required a bit of research, but overall
	I think it works well. As far as I am concerned, my program does not crash and every time a value that is entered
	that does not meet my requirements, the program asks the user to re-enter until they enter a valid value.
</p>
				<p>In this sprint I also did a lot of formatting fixes. I made the program a lot easier
				to read by spacing out different items and by separating different sections with lines. I also
				added some extra confirmation steps such as finalising the order, then confirming the order
				in my review function, to make sure the user was content with the details entered.</p>
				<p>Although it was not in my original plan, I decided to add in a "extra notes" feature
				to my program. The reason I decided to add this was because for my delivery function,
				I asked for the st number and name. I did this to try and make sure only valid st addresses
				were accepted. However, while I was trialling my program on my family members, one of them
				asked about apartment deliveries.
				</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>
					So, after getting inspiration from online shopping, I decided
				to add a feature that asks the user if they have any extra notes to add. This means that the
				user is able to add if they want their pizza dropped of specifically at their apartment number,
				or any other additional notes such as drop off at the back entrance. The extra notes
					are printed out on the "receipt". If the user chooses not to
					enter any extra notes, no extra notes are printed out on the "receipt".
				</p>
		<p>Although I was not able to complete it in my timeframe, for a future sprint I could look into
		making pizzas customisable, so the customer can add extra toppings etc or adding a drinks menu to my program.</p>


<h3>Github</h3>
<p>Throughout my project, I used Github to store my project as well as using their
backlog planning system to help organise and structure my project. I frequently
uploaded my code to github using terminal, so that I was able to retrieve code
if something went wrong. As well as this, I also used Github's kanban boards
to plan my intentions for each sprint and prioritise which aspects needed to be
completed first.
</p>
	<p>The Kanban board
	is designed so that you can move cards with information on them to the column
	that represents its completion. This was helpful when I was creating my program as it allowed
me to stay on track and helped to remind me of what needed to get done. The board
